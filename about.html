                <p>My name is Norlyn Piquero and feel free to call me by my nickname Yen, I am a licensed Chemical Engineer turned Freelancer. I have been helping small business owners and startup entrepreneurs for more than a year. Offering Web Design, Elementor WordPress Development, Social Media Management and other Administrative tasks.</p>
                <p>I love woking for clients that has the right values and really has the passion in making people's lives a little less difficult.</p> 
                <p>I look forward to helping non-profit organizations and people who are not just passionate but has the perseverance to succeed in their endeavours.</p>
                <p class="dark">I am a self-taught Web Designer and I am currently learning more about Front-End Web Development/Design online. I can't wait to finish the course and get myself more meaningful projects using the skills I will acquire after finishing the course.</p>
                <p>While I enjoy learning, I also love to spend some of my time outdoors. I love trekking, reading a book while enjoying a nice cup of coffee, catching up with my friends, just strolling at the beach and meditating. Other topics that I am interested in are Minimalism, Stoicism, Taoism, and Self-Improvement subjects.</p>
                <p>I strive to be better in what I do and I love how I design my life. I am far from being the best or the most knowledgeable, I embrace my failures and adversities in life. I would like to think that I am an alchemist, who constantly find ways in turning my adversities to my advantage.</p>
                <p>My favorite quote is <q>Fall Seven, Rise Eight</q>. Whenever I am faced with overwhelming challenges, I remind myself with this Japanese proverb and my life is basically guided by this quote.</p>
                <p>I hope you enjoyed knowing a little bit about me. Thank you for your time and looking forward to helping you.</p>
